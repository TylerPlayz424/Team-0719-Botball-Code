# Team 0719 Botball Code and Plan

## Smaller Robot
It will travel to the tower, and turn on the light switch.
Then it will move towards the solar panel, plowing puffs and rocks to their locations
And it will flip the solar panel

## Create 3
It will move toward the 3 in pvc pipe to catch the purple noodle.   It will wait for the other robot to flip the switch
Then it will take the noodle to the lunar area and put a noodle into a 3 in pvc pipe.
Then we will code it so it can pick up a large yellow block off the tower
